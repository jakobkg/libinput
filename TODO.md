# TODO

* Implement more joystick functionality
  * Directly read raw stick value(s)
* Gamecube adapter support
  * At least support for the Gamecube controller in any port
  * Look into other controllers like the DK Bongos for giggles
* Fully rewrite to make object-oriented
  * Having a single Controller() class with children for various controller types to make everything nice and abstract for devs

* Comment my code so it's possible to use without reading all the dumb things I wrote
  
* Fix things that I inevitably break at some point
